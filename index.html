                                    I immigrated from Nepal at the age of 5, and grew up in Texas.
                                    I was always fascinated by physics and computers, and graduated from a STEM oriented
                                    high school (the School of Science and Engineering in Dallas, TX) in 2017.
                                    I then pursued my interest and graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Computer
                                    Science and Electrical Engineering and a second major in Physics from MIT
                                    (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in 2021. During this time, I worked on
                                    various clubs related to entrepeneurship (DeltaV and MIT II) and helped build a
                                    large part of a startup and smaller parts of other startups. I also led the MIT UAV
                                    (Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle) Club and
                                    was the webmaster for the
                                    ISA (International Students Association).
                                    </br></br>
                                    I enjoyed learning about Reinforcement Learning (RL), and pursued a MEng (Master of
                                    Engineering) in Computer Science with a focus on RL and AI. I
                                    graduated with my
                                    masters degree in 2022, also from MIT, with grad classes focusing on systems,
                                    security, and AI. For my MEng, I am indebted to all those who I was fortunate enough
                                    to work
                                    with, from Professor
                                    Cathy Wu
                                    at MIT to Taylor Hogan and Luke Roberto at Cadence Design Systems, and a whole host
                                    more people.
                                    I now work at Google as a Software Engineer working on authentication flows.
                                    </br></br>
                                    Outside of work, I can be found tinkering on drones, making beats, learning
                                    astrophotography, exploring software ideas, and playing a range of sports (anything
                                    from MMA to Tennis, with powerlifting and Calisthenics as a crutch).
                                    When able, I also love to volunteer. I had my first batch of mentees this year at
                                    work, for example!
                                    </br></br>
                                    I'm very thankful to everyone who has helped me on my journey so far, from
                                    (especially) family, to friends, co-workers, mentors, and mentees, and look forward
                                    to continuing to work towards
                                    building great projects.

                                    During this time, I worked on
                                    various clubs related to entrepeneurship (DeltaV and MIT II) and helped build a
                                    large part of a startup and smaller parts of other startups. I played an integral
                                    role in building Buddy, a 'mental health fitbit' my freshman summer (and throughout
                                    my
                                    freshman year) - I built a large part of the initial codebase and underlying
                                    systems.
                                    </br></br>
                                    Unfortunately, due to classes piling up Sophomore year, I was not able to continue
                                    my commitment to Buddy. I did continue participating in the MIT entrepeneurship
                                    scene, and
                                    worked with a few friends I met at DeltaV on a few other ideas, but personal
                                    situations
                                    made me choose to push for a more stable career path.
                                    </br></br>
                                    I interned at a company helping autistic children learn to work with emotions
                                    through
                                    AR tools, named Brain Power, for my sophomore externship and summer internship.
                                    I built systems that read high fidelity sensory data that allowed accurate
                                    information
                                    to be fed to these AR tools and systems.
                                    </br></br>
                                    I then went on to work at Amazon's Prime Video department for
                                    my junior year internship. I built high throughput systems to push through
                                    content generated via machine learning models.

                                    I also led the MIT UAV
                                    (Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle) Club and
                                    was the webmaster for the

                                    I'm indebted to all the friends and professional relationships I made during this
                                    time.
                                    </br></br>
                                    I enjoyed learning about Reinforcement Learning (RL), and pursued a MEng (Master of

                                    </br></br>

                                    During this time, I built a RL based feedback-loop system, inspired by AlphaGo, that
                                    was able to solve various printed circuit boards (PCBs) that were left unsolved. I
                                    focused
                                    on trying to make the feedback loop have a property of constant improvement on every
                                    loop in
                                    terms of numbers of actions taken to solve the board.
                                    </br></br>

                                    My graduate level classes, which were taken in between my senior year and my
                                    masters, involved
                                    security, AI, and systems. For example, I really enjoyed 6.858, where we rebuilt
                                    SUNDR, a
                                    K:V store that had fork consistency and was unable to know the contents of the data
                                    it stored.
                                    This is a precursor to Bitcoin. I really enjoyed 6.824, which was a distributed
                                    systems class.
                                    We built RAFT from scratch in this class in Go. 6.843 was a robotic manipulation
                                    class that I also
                                    enjoyed, and built a 'robot manipulation' version of my masters thesis on a much
                                    smaller scale.
                                    Another class I really enjoed was 6.481, which helped connect statistics and
                                    probability theory
                                    all the way through to Machine Learning and advanced hypothesis testing. I highly
                                    enjoyed a PSET
                                    where we 'discovered the higgs boson' through combinations of neural network
                                    predictions and P-Value testing.
                                    It really brought things together!
                                    </br></br>

                                    I now work at Google as a Software Engineer working on authentication flows.

                                    I'm very thankful to everyone who has helped me on my journey so far, from
                                    (especially) family, to friends, co-workers, mentors, and mentees, and look forward
                                    to continuing to work towards
                                    building great projects.
                                </p>
